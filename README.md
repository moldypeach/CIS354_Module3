===========================

Recursive Character Counter

Write a recursive function that finds the number of occurrences of a specified letter in a string using the following
function header:

    int count( const string& s, char a )
    
For example, count("Welcome", 'e') returns 2. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a string and a
character, and displays the number of occurrences for the character in the string.
